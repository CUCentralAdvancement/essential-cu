                You give with an eye on the future—to create solutions tomorrow for the challenges we face today. Endowments are investments in that future. They’re gifts that support CU forever because they generate reliable support for generations to come. CU’s collective endowment is made up of thousands of individual endowments, and just like a current gift, an endowment has a specific purpose determined by the donor: It could be a scholarship that’s awarded year after year, or support to attract a sought-after faculty chair or the creation of a mental health and wellness program.
