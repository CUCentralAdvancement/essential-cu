And how could he help transition Peak Vista Community Health Centers, where he works as senior vice president of medical services, to a telehealth model to serve its 93,000 patients in the Pikes Peak region of Southern Colorado during the pandemic?\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETanaka soon found answers and a collaborative spirit through ECHO Colorado, a technology-based peer mentoring model at CU Anschutz. This virtual community connects health professionals to experts and each other so they can learn collectively about health topics and the best ways to support their\u0026nbsp;patients.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cWhen you see or hear about several different providers or practices struggling with the same thing you are, it\u2019s extremely helpful and reassuring in a way that you\u2019re not missing the mark. Ideas get pooled together in a common forum, and it allows for the sharing of information instead of little pockets of best practices. This really benefits patients and centers throughout the entire state. For me, the most rewarding part is that it connects everybody and it makes me feel less isolated. ECHO Colorado is a great example of how the medical community is leveraging technology.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A man stands outside in a blue dress shirt; the wind blows his tie up a little and there is a huge cloud off in the distance. \u0022 data-caption=\u0022Joel Tanaka, MD\u0022 data-entity-type=\u0022file\u0022 data-entity-uuid=\u0022d00174b5-f349-4128-8bfe-0f9593111896\u0022 src=\u0022https://res.cloudinary.com/hs9mwpicm/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1614723831/ir-20/stories/anschutz-echo/amc-echo-body-1_h9ti22.jpg\u0022 \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst started in New Mexico, the program expanded to Colorado in 2015, thanks to generous funding from the Colorado Health Foundation, the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Finance, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and Health Resources and Services Administration.

We\u2019re all getting the same information, and our patients benefit because this allows us to get very timely, appropriate and pertinent information into the hands of our frontline providers.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n",
