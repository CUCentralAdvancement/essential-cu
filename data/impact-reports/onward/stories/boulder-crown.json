Uncertainty has increased the complexity of their challenges, which is why the work of the Ren\u00e9e Crown Wellness Institute at CU Boulder is more critical\u0026nbsp;than ever.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA transformational gift in 2019 established the Crown Institute, where Sona Dimidjian serves as director. She is also a professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience and the inaugural holder of the Sapp Family Endowed Chancellor\u0027s Chair for Research Excellence.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A group of five researchers - three women and two men - stand outside on the CU Boulder campus. \u0022 data-caption=\u0022The five founding scholars of the Crown Institute are: Kathy Schultz, Ben Kirshner, Sona Dimidjian, Erik Willcutt and Yuko Munakata (from left to right).\u0022 data-entity-type=\u0022file\u0022 data-entity-uuid=\u00228034beda-a09b-46df-91e5-90a3e76167c8\u0022 src=\u0022https://res.cloudinary.com/hs9mwpicm/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1614731544/ir-20/stories/boulder-crown/ucb-crown-body-3_bmmx91.jpg\u0022 \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDimidjian says the Crown Institute is committed to interdisciplinary research and integrated partnerships to improve the health and well-being of children, youth, educators, families and schools in Colorado communities.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cThe questions we ask and the problems we strive to solve are grounded in trust with our community partners \u2014\u0026nbsp;they might be educators in schools, community organizations, or students in schools or on our campus. Young people need connection to thrive, and science and research need connection to have real impact. This means connecting across traditional disciplinary boundaries within the university, and it also means connecting beyond the traditional walls of the university.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Crown Institute\u2019s scholars study mindfulness, compassion, belonging, dignity\u0026nbsp;and agency. Research programs address disparities in mental health, wellness\u0026nbsp;and education associated with gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, linguistic diversity, geography, income\u0026nbsp;and other structural and systemic inequities with a focus on access, justice, and dignity.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis fall, the Crown Institute collaborated\u0026nbsp;with CU Boulder\u0027s College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Education, the College of Media, Information and Communications,\u0026nbsp;and the Division\u0026nbsp;of Student Affairs to design and build an online course for first-year CU students. With input from a\u0026nbsp;team of 14 students and more than 30 faculty members across the campus, the course addressed\u0026nbsp;mental health and well-being needs in response to COVID-19, as well as systemic injustice.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cThere\u0027s so much stigma around the sharing of personal challenges and the pressure to appear as though we, our families and even our communities have it all together. I think what\u0027s really important right now is that people are speaking their truth about\u0026nbsp;the ways in which they are having a hard time, and communities are coming together to address historical injustice.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EScholars like Dimidjian use their research to create a brighter tomorrow for future generations.

We also know that they are experiencing unprecedented levels of mental health concern, stress and challenges. We see both the power and the promise that children and youth bring forth into the world, and we hold this sense of responsibility to help them determine what kind of legacy they want to have and what needs to change in the world today.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n",
