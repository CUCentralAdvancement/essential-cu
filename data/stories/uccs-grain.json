Bread, one of the foundations of human civilization, crosses cultures in its many forms \u2013 tortillas, challah, naan, sourdough \u2013 and is a reassuring comfort of human life.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis renewed appreciation for home baking is a bright spot in what has been a dark year, says Andy Clark, owner and baker at Moxie Bread Company in Louisville, Colorado, just south of Boulder.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cYou know, I\u0027ve had more conversations this year with people I know that I would never in a million years think would take the time to bake bread at home. There\u0027s nothing quite as heartfelt, genuine and loving as receiving a loaf of bread from your neighbor or your grandmother or a friend. It\u2019s a symbolic gesture of appreciation and love.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EClark first started baking as a teenager in a New England shop. Now, thanks to a University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) initiative funded by generous donors, Grain School is inviting people like Clark to embrace and contribute to Colorado\u2019s grain industry.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cGrain School is really like the Woodstock of the grain world. It\u0027s not simply a class on how to make a better baguette. There\u0027s the cultural importance of grain to the people here in Colorado and to the Indigenous tribes of the Southwest and Mexico, and it\u2019s not often you get the opportunity to experience that.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 2016, Grain School has evolved into an annual three-day seminar at UCCS.
