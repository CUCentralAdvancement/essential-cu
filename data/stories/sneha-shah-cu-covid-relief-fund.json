So they agreed to have coffee on a Wednesday morning and walk around the Tennyson neighborhood in Denver. Eventually, Shah reluctantly asked Minton if they could go to his apartment: she needed to change into scrubs for her first night shift. Before she left, Minton was even kind enough to let her attempt to play a few notes on his cello. Which she did \u2014 badly, as she recalls.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENow a couple for three years, Shah and Minton faced their biggest challenge together yet.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the coronavirus hit this spring, Shah knew as a medical resident she would be on the frontlines of the pandemic.

Trevor is a very strong person, but I definitely saw a change in him. As you can imagine for any person who has a significant job loss, it was just terrifying to think that he might have to give up cello as a career.
