Jefferson planned to be a neurosurgeon.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThough he volunteered at a local high school and a teen center, Jefferson never considered education as a career until a student told him that he would be a good teacher.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Jefferson is an assistant professor studying education equity in the School of Education and Human Development at CU Denver. Last year, he was chosen as part of the inaugural cohort for the TIAA Chancellor\u0027s Urban Engaged Scholars program, which elevates the outstanding contributions of CU Denver faculty to the Denver metro area through their research and creative activities.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A man sits on the steps outside a high school. \u0022 data-caption=\u0022Antwan Jefferson\u0022 data-entity-type=\u0022file\u0022 data-entity-uuid=\u0022659af5a7-1bdd-427d-8263-81cc58b3c654\u0022 src=\u0022https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/huv4e9aub\/image\/upload\/v1\/inline-images\/ucd-urban-body-1\u0022 \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEach CU Denver scholar\u0027s research addresses current urban issues while emphasizing community partnerships, local impact and student involvement \u2014 research and discovery supported by TIAA\u2019s philanthropic partnership with the university.

He taught at Montbello High School, a Denver-area\u0026nbsp;school that struggled academically and ultimately closed.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cI had the opportunity to work alongside some of those fascinating and creative children who were in the school where the reputation of the school preceded their personal experiences. The school at the time was predominantly Black and Latino and in a working-class community, and I wanted to understand it better.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn his research, he saw that urban families, especially families of color, immigrant families and families from limited economic backgrounds, cared\u0026nbsp;about factors beyond the school\u2019s performance on standardized tests. They wanted to know how many teachers of color were employed at the school, the length of tenure of teachers and the school\u2019s approach to disciplinary measures.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cThe values that families hold onto to guide their decisions about what they believe education should be about for their own children are not aligned or represented by the information that the school district makes available to them. It\u0027s not giving families what they need or ask for. It\u2019s giving them instead what they should be satisfied with, which means that families\u2019 voices are not driving the district in terms of measuring school quality. That\u0027s inequitable.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EJefferson is partnering with local schools in the Denver metro area to help identify ways to improve the educational experience for Denver\u2019s youth and their families. That\u2019s one of the benefits of the Urban Engaged Scholars program, Jefferson says: living and working in the same community he studies so he knows his work\u0026nbsp;is making a difference.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cI value the experiences and wisdom of people who actually have something to lose if the systems they participate\u0026nbsp;in don\u0027t work. Donor support to CU helps the university serve a greater public good: it\u2019s about ensuring that children from all backgrounds have fair and just opportunities to secure their own futures and shape the future of society.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n","priority":4,"slug":"denver-urban","interest_tag":"Research","campus_tag":"Denver","image_main":{"alt":"A man looks off to the side and smiles; he is wearing a gray shirt.
