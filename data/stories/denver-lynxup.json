I told him, \u2018I\u2019m not going to school.\u2019 He looked me dead in the eye and said, \u2018I will be mad at you for the rest of my life if you do not go and pursue your career at CU Denver.\u2019 This was my dream, and he didn\u2019t want to hold me back. As much as I wanted to stay home, I remember sitting next to his bed, holding his hand and thinking, \u2018I am going to do this for me, but I am also doing this for you because you helped me find my voice in music.\u2019 \u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A young woman sits in front of a mural with her guitar. \u0022 data-caption=\u0022Alana Margolis\u0022 data-entity-type=\u0022file\u0022 data-entity-uuid=\u00227d68838e-e6c6-4677-92fd-77912ae264f4\u0022 src=\u0022https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/huv4e9aub\/image\/upload\/v1\/inline-images\/CU_AlanaMargolis0206\u0022 \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter her father\u2019s passing, the financial aid office at CU Denver worked to get Margolis scholarship support so she could stay enrolled without taking on unexpected debt or dropping out of school.
