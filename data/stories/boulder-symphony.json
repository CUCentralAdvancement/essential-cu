When people are experiencing any kind of uncertainty or instability in their lives, music is something that almost everybody can find a way to empathize with. That\u0027s what I think is beautiful: that music can say what often people cannot say to each other explicitly.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe virtual orchestra performed an \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mMpRIJi2dtc\u0022\u003Eoriginal\u0026nbsp;symphony by Holloway\u003C\/a\u003E, which he wrote early on as a CU Boulder freshman\u0026nbsp;thanks, he says in part,\u0026nbsp;to\u0026nbsp;scholarships.
