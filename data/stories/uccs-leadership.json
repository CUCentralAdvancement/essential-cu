I just really liked science and math, but I also really liked people. In high school, I started looking at different schools around the state of Colorado; I\u0027m a native of Colorado Springs, and I really do love it here. But when I was looking into the different nursing programs, the one through Beth-El\u202fat UCCS really caught my eye; it had a great reputation.\u201d\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA career in nursing was always\u0026nbsp;Hofreiter\u2019s\u0026nbsp;passion.\u0026nbsp;Participating in the Chancellor\u2019s Leadership Class (CLC), a\u0026nbsp;scholarship program at UCCS,\u0026nbsp;as an undergraduate student\u0026nbsp;gave her the confidence and skills to make\u0026nbsp;her academic and career goals\u0026nbsp;a reality.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 2003, 156 UCCS students have graduated from CLC and 39 students are currently enrolled.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cScholarships are invaluable; they have given me so much.
