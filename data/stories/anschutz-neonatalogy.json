We know that here in the United States about 10 percent of all infants are preterm who need intensive care for what could be weeks to months. And we care for full-term infants who are medically complex, such as those who have birth defects or those who might have had complications at delivery. We support their growth and development so they eventually will be ready to go home, but it can be a long road. But the progress and strength that these infants and their families demonstrate is incredible and that motivates me.\u201d\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHwang treats high-risk infants in the NICU at Children\u0027s Hospital\u0026nbsp;Colorado\u0026nbsp;and at the University of Colorado.\u0026nbsp;As a researcher,\u0026nbsp;Hwang\u0026nbsp;studies\u0026nbsp;the social determinants and predictors of infant and maternal health.\u0026nbsp;Some of her research topics have included sudden infant death syndrome and safe sleep practices, opioid exposure on newborns, the effect of secondhand smoke on breastfeeding, and the standards of care for mothers and newborns at birthing hospitals.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cUnfortunately in the U.S., we know that mothers and infants of under-resourced communities such as Black families, Hispanic families, immigrant communities and those who have lower socioeconomic status and lower educational levels have an overrepresentation in the NICU.
